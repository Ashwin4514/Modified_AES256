# AES-256 Modification with Dynamic SBox and Custom PRNG

## **Overview**

This project implements a modified version of the AES-256 encryption algorithm. The enhancements include a dynamic SBox substitution mechanism powered by a ChaCha20-based pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) and flexible parameterization to explore new cryptographic techniques. This implementation provides a balance between strong encryption and a modular design for customization and experimentation.

## **Key Features**

### **Dynamic SBox Substitution**

- Utilizes a ChaCha20-based PRNG to dynamically generate constants for SBox substitution.
- Enhances security by introducing round-dependent randomness to the substitution process.
- Increases resilience against attacks targeting static substitution tables.

### **Modified AES-256 Workflow**

- Retains the core AES structure with 14 rounds of transformations.
- Includes:
  - **AddRoundKey**: XORs the state with round-specific keys.
  - **Dynamic SBox Substitution**: Replaces static SBoxes with PRNG-generated transformations.
  - **ShiftRows**: Circular byte shifts for diffusion.
  - **MixColumns**: Multiplication in GF(2^8) for further diffusion in encryption; **InverseMixColumns** for decryption.
  
### **ChaCha20-based PRNG**

- Generates pseudo-random values for SBox transformations.
- Incorporates a 256-bit seed and round-dependent input to ensure unique outputs for each encryption round.

### **Flexible Design**

- Parameterized for easy experimentation with:
  - Number of rounds (default: 14).
  - Key size (default: 256 bits).
  - Custom PRNG integration.

### **Comprehensive Decryption Path**

- Implements inverse transformations:
  - **InverseShiftRows**: Reverses the byte shifts.
  - **InverseSubBytes**: Uses PRNG outputs to reverse dynamic SBox transformations.
  - **InverseMixColumns**: Undoes column mixing for decryption.

## **Architecture**

The system is designed using modular Verilog code, with each AES transformation encapsulated in its module:

- **Encryption Path**: Implements the full encryption process, including **MixColumns** for rounds 1–13 and the final round with no mixing.
- **Decryption Path**: Mirrors the encryption process using inverse transformations, with **InverseMixColumns** applied in all rounds except the final round.
- **Key Expansion Module**: Generates round keys for all transformations.
- **PRNG Module**: Dynamically generates round-specific constants.

---

## **Code Highlights**

- **Encryption Module:**
  - Chains all AES rounds with dynamic SBox substitutions and applies **MixColumns** in rounds 1–13 for diffusion.
  - The last round skips **MixColumns** but still applies the other transformations.
  - Displays intermediate states for debugging and verification.
  
- **Decryption Module:**
  - Applies inverse transformations in reverse order for seamless plaintext recovery, skipping **InverseMixColumns** in the last round.
  
- **PRNG:**
  - ChaCha20-inspired generator ensures reproducible randomness for cryptographic strength.

## **Usage**

### **Encryption Example**

In the encryption process, each round involves the following transformations:
1. **AddRoundKey**: The plaintext is XORed with a round key.
2. **Dynamic SBox Substitution**: The bytes are substituted using a dynamic SBox generated by the ChaCha20-based PRNG.
3. **ShiftRows**: The rows are cyclically shifted.
4. **MixColumns**: For rounds 1–13, the bytes undergo a matrix multiplication in GF(2^8), spreading the influence of each byte across the columns.

The last round (round 14) skips **MixColumns** and performs the following:
- **AddRoundKey**.
- **Dynamic SBox Substitution**.
- **ShiftRows**.

### **Decryption Example**

In the decryption process, the operations are applied in reverse order:
1. **AddRoundKey**: The ciphertext is XORed with the round key in reverse.
2. **InverseSubBytes**: Each byte is substituted using the inverse of the dynamic SBox.
3. **InverseShiftRows**: The rows are cyclically shifted back to their original position.
4. **InverseMixColumns**: For rounds 1–13, the inverse of the MixColumns operation is applied to undo the mixing in the encryption process.

The last round (round 14) skips **InverseMixColumns** and performs the following:
- **AddRoundKey**.
- **InverseSubBytes**.
- **InverseShiftRows**.
